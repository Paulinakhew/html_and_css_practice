The jubilant cheers coming from the Maple Leafs' locker-room could have very easily been swapped out for a collective sigh of relief.

Nazem Kadri recorded his fifth-career hat trick as part of a four-point night and Auston Matthews snapped the second-longest goal drought of his career Wednesday as Toronto defeated the free-falling Washington Capitals 6-3.

William Nylander, who came in with just four points in 20 games since the end of his contract impasse, added three assists as the Leafs picked up a much-needed win heading into the NHL all-star break and their league-mandated bye week.
"We wanted this one," Kadri said. "We wanted to feel good about ourselves."

Toronto, which doesn't play again until Feb. 1, had lost two straight, five of six at Scotiabank Arena — including four in a row — and seven of its last 10 overall.

"We've felt like we've been trending in the right direction," Kadri added. "It's definitely nice to play a full 60 (minutes) and beat a good team."

Nikita Zaitsev and Mitch Marner, into an empty net, had the other goals for the Leafs (30-17-2), while Morgan Rielly and Connor Brown added two assists each.

"Once we put in that kind of work, we can play with anybody," said Toronto goalie Frederik Andesen, who stopped 41 shots.
